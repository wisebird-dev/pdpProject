# pdpProject

This project is part of my personal development plan at Agile Actors. My aim is to use technologies and practices that I am not familiar with in order to build an e-commerce site and futher develop my professional skills.

One of the major aims of this project is to set up the toolchain from the scratch, in order to familiarise myself with the whole process of creating an application, rather than writing code on top of a pre-configured development environment.

-   React 18
-   Webpack 5
-   Babel
