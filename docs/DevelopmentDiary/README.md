# Diary

I will try to maintain a developement diary of my efforts and way of thinking in order to have logs of the development proccess. The entries will be top level and will not go into technical details for ease of navigation and reading. Any tech specific decision will be covered in the docs/ADRs session of the application. The diary aims to keep a log of major developement thresholds.
