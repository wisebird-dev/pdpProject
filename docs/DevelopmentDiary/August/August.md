I refactored the server to follow the ducks structure pattern. I will also add the https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux link for future reference when I add redux to the codebase.

P.S strictly speaking ducks is a pattern for structuring redux folders but I will be using it to describe the modular approach it advocates. The broader and more accurate term would be the law of Demeter that I previously mentioned https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter.
